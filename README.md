## What we've learned with this project
Before this project began a great inspiration 
for the love for music was taken for this project, 
the passion for music was the essence of this project.
<br>
<br>
With this deep inspiration, the desire to learn an array 
of concepts from Digital Signal Processing and Audio 
Engineering, was born. We soon realized that in order to 
be successful in this project we must understand concepts 
of Digital Signal Processing and Audio Engineering like; 
Fast Fourier Transform, Time Domain, Frequency Domain, 
Dual Channel, Frequency Bins, Hertz, Musical Notes, WAV files, 
and Pitch, just to name a few.

### Ruben's notes:
<br>
With a basic understanding of these concepts we grasped the ability 
to build Sequence of Nature.<br>
